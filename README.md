- 👋 Hi, I’m @sebrod06, but you can call me Sebastian!
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering and computer science, as well as many other facets of the STEM field.
- 🌱 I’m currently in AP Computer Science A, so I'm learning Java, and I am learning the basics to be an engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects wherever help is needed, as well as collaborating on my own little projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: @sebastian.rodriguez.2020 on Instagram, or through my email: rodri369159@student.aisd.net
